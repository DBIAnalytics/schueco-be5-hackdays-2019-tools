* wind_speed -> The wind speed in m/s
* ambient_temperature -> The temparature in Â°C
* sun_state -> If it's currently 'Dark', 'Sunny', 'Cloudy' or 'Rainy' - all estimated from each row's 'timestamp'

* userdefined_double_2 -> The relative humidity in %
* userdefined_double_3 -> The airpressure in pascal

The application stops when the "Enter" key is pressed.
